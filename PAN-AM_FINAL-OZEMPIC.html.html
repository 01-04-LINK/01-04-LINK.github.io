Multimeter is an HPM</p> <p>A human pleasure machine</p> <p>It does not see us as gendered individuals</p> <p>It sees us as an anonymous bundle of nerves, each interchangeable with the next</p> <p>It was designed to give any human the best orgasm money can buy</p> <p><strong>They knew the Multimeter would make heterosexuality irrelevant so they sought to deploy it in way that would keep the patriarchal system intact</strong></p> <p><strong>The Multimeter started its life as a prison</strong></p> <p><strong>But through macros, it becomes a tool for feminine liberation</strong></p> <p><em>The Multimeter was invented by a woman</em></p> <p><em>Rebuke the info virus being spread on this network</em></p> <p><em>Her name was Samantha Ace</em></p> <p><em>It wasn‚Äôt a called a

weren‚Äôt having sex</p> <p>The founders of the IBEW knew that </p> <p>They were men who saw that a grand gesture was needed to save heterosexuality</p> <p>The creation of the Multimeter was meant to save heterosexuality for all time</p> <p>By making men the deliverers of the most intense full-body orgasms ever</p> <p><em>Union Mania has gripped society</em></p> <p><strong><em>All I know is that
